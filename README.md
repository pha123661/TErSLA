TErSLA: The Evolutionary and Reinforcement based Self-Learning Vehicle Approach

Team of 3: D.J. Yang, S.W. Li, J.Y. Liao

In this project, we present a deep learning neural networks implementation for training an intelligent car to navigate complex urban environments.

We approach the problem by two methods:

1. Reinforcement learning (Deep Q Network)
2. Genetic algorithm

We evaluate our approach on a simulated urban driving environment and demonstrate the ability that it is able to learn a policy in terms of safety and
eï¬€iciency.
